        <h2>Evaluate A News Article with Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>Built a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on
          articles or blogs found on other websites.</p>
        <p> Core skills: Used webpack as a build tool for defining the entry point, loaders, plugins and mode to create a dependency graph for this application.
         Node and express is used for the webserver and routing. The app has dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
        Core skills: Developed an understanding of how to use build tools, such as Webpack, for automating build tasks. Created CSS variables and configured Webpack with Sass controlled stylesheets. 
        Learned how to cache server data and website functionality using Service Worker.

        <h2>Capstone - travPlan App</h2>
        <p>I built a travel application called `travPlan`. This capstone was mainly focused in adding, saving and
          deleting travel plans.
        <p> Core skills: This application focuses on all things learned during this course.
          travPlan app gets input of the location and date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location
          using information obtained from external APIs. This project is completely build from scratch on vanilla javascript, working with objects and DOM elements to
          retrieve data from 3 different APIs (geonames, pixabay, and weatherbit).
          Finally, used Webpack environment, using an express server, and with service workers .</p>
