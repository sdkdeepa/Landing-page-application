        <h2> Personal Blog Website</h2>
        <p>This project requires you to utilize your HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including
          custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately
          structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.</p>
        <p>Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Personal Blog Website project
          rubric. Please make sure to re-review the rubric for detailed project requirements prior to submission. In
          this project, you'll get to start from scratch! To complete the project, you are able to decide on the HTML
          and CSS files to include as part of your work, given that the end result is within the confines of the project
          rubric provided below.</p>

        <h2>Landing page</h2>
        <p>This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational
          menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.</p>
        <p>This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be
          using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how
          javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of
          what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic. </p>

        <h2>Weather Journal App</h2>
        <p>This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically
          update the UI in a Weather Journal application.</p>
        <p>Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the Weather-Journal project rubric.
          Please review the rubric for detailed project requirements. If you'd like to start from scratch without any
          files, you are encouraged to do so! You learn the most by developing on your own. But, it can be a bit
          challenging having to start from scratch, so we do provide a starter project (i.e., a "skeleton") to use.</p>

        <h2>Evaluate A News Article with Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>This project requires you to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on
          articles or blogs found on other websites.</p>
        <p>The motive of this project is to have you a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come
          across in a front end role. Your focus should be to understand the role every tool and technology is playing
          in the overall architecture. You shouldnâ€™t feel the need to memorize the particular commands, config setups,
          or structure that we create here. Every projetc in the industry will have its own custom setup, but if you
          understand the moving pieces, you will be able to get the gist of even far more complicated projects than this
          one.</p>
