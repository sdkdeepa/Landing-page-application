        <h2> Personal Blog Website</h2>
        <p>I built a personal art blog website with three page navigations containing my personal art images, responsive layouts, and styling. Some of the considerations for this projects are appropriately
          structuring files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.</p>
        <p> Understand different use cases for CSS Grid and Flexbox, and structure the layout of a web page using grid columns and rows.</p>

        <h2>Landing page</h2>
        <p>This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational
          menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.</p>
        <p>Uses JavaScript to control a webpage using DOM to dictate page content and interactions. 
          worked with Browser Events and managing website performance by controlling content creation efficiently.
          This project focuses on manipulating the DOM. The functionality serves two purposes. Firstly, append dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how
          javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

        <p>This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically
          update the UI in a Weather Journal application.</p>
        <p>Set up a Node and Express environment so you can develop web applications on your local machine, and learn to handle HTTP Requests & Routes. 
          Update and modify website elements dynamically using asynchronously retrieved data.</p>

        <h2>Evaluate A News Article with Natural Language Processing</h2>
        <p>This project requires you to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on
          articles or blogs found on other websites.</p>
        <p> Using webpack as a build tool for defining the entry point, loaders, plugins and mode to create a dependency graph for the project.
         Node and express is used for the webserver and routing. The app has dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
        Core skills: Develop an understanding of how to use build tools, such as Webpack, for automating build tasks. Create CSS variables with Sass and configure Webpack to use Sass controlled stylesheets. 
        Learn how to cache server data and website functionality using Service Worker.

        <h2>Capstone - travPlan App</h2>
        <p>I built a travel application called `travPlan`. This capstone was mainly focused in adding, saving and
          deleting travel plans.
        <p>
          This app gets input of the location and date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location
          using information obtained from external APIs. This project is completely build from scratch on vanilla javascript, working with objects and DOM elements to
          retrieve data from 3 different APIs (geonames, pixabay, and weatherbit).
          Finally, used Webpack environment, using an express server, and with service workers .</p>
