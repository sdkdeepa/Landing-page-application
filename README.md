# Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree

Udacity's project 2 mainly focuses students to get hands on experience in the DOM manipulation using Javascript. I have created a navigation bar with links using DOM. 

### Project details:

In the nutshell this project needs focus on the following areas:

1. Add the Fourth section (hard-coded).
2. Create Four navbar items corresponding to each section (dynamically).

Couple of visuals needs to be added using JS only

3.  Clicking the navbar item >>> scrolling the viewport to the target section. Check this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView
4. Clicking the navbar item >>> highlighting the item background for the user to follow easily where s/he surfing. Check this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaBLwm_0QAE
